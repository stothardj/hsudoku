Haskell Sudoku Solver

This program finds all solutions to sudoku boards of all sizes.

you specify the size of the board, the number of rows in a box within
the board, the number of columns in a box in the board, and then the board.
The number 0 in the board is used to repreent an open square.

This program was written for practice. Criticism is welcome.
